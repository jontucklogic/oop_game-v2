# Project 4 - OOP GameShow App

## Project Details
* An introductory page is displayed with the title of the game and the play button, and once clicked, the page changes, revealing the game board itself.
* The game showcases blank squares (which reveal individual letters), a keyboard in which the user can click on the notes or the actual key on their laptop or desktop, and five hearts on the bottom, which represents the life bar.
* The goal of the game is to guess all the numbers in the mystery word correctly.
* Whenever a user selects a letter, that current letter  will be able to be chosen again and becomes disabled. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, it will not be shown on the screen and instead loses one of their hearts. When the user runs out of hearts before they guess the correct word, a game over screen displays and notifies them that they have lost and if they want to  play again.
* When a user selects the correct letter within the mystery word, all letters within that word will be revealed from the blank squares on the screen. If the user manages to guess the entire word correctly without losing all their hearts, a game over screen appears with a "You've won!" message..
## Added Styles
* When the user guesses a correct letter, the game reveals one of the blank squares on the screen, and the background of that letter is highlighted blue. The letter reacts with a little bounce or zoom-in-like effect, further indicating that they have guessed the correct word!
